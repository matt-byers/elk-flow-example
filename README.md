# React + TypeScript + Vite

Demo of using ELK to position nodes in a ReactFlow graph. Currently working for:
- Large nodes (500px width, 200-500px height)
- Variable height nodes
- Re-layout on expand/collapse
- Re-layout before overlaps
- All last nodes link to single last node

### To demo

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
